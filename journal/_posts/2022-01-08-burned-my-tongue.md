Forgot to eat before going to tattoo someone today and got so shaky and had to run off and buy food in the middle of the appointment but realized I didn't have my wallet so I tried to set up apple pay on my phone quickly but then it said i had to call my bank so i did but that wasn't quick so I went in a k-fried-chicken place and put an uber eats order for pickup for just sweet potato fries and scarfed like half the box and burned my tongue VERY BADLY and it's 1:03am at night rn and it's still tingly burnt. and i felt badly because i left the tattoo client there for like 30 mins.  
  
binge-watched a whole third (12 episodes is only less than a third lmfao) of feng qi luo yang today. it's so good. first show i've seen where it baits the straight couple pretty much as hard as other shows queerbait. based on a tweet i saw i think they don't even end up kissing by the end of the show. maybe all cdramas are like that though. huang xuan is so hot.    
  
ugh but the romance in this show at first i was like eewwwwww no what a bad pairing but i think that was partially because the writing of wu siyue is so inconsistent, like sometimes she acts 12 and sometimes she acts 35. but then later in the show its like wowow competent pairings in a cdrama what.  
  
there's literally one fic on ao3 in english of this show (which is actually pretty good) that ISN'T shipping wyb with himself (like they're all xovers with a character the same guy plays in a different show, which is wack because it's all porn fics). maybe this will finally be the motivation to draw fanart because apparently it doesn't exist.

also it's really weird that it's 2022. what a weird start to 2022. also maybe i should stop segmenting time in my head, it really fuels the intense need i have for planning. i plan so much and then i don't actually live that much.  
for so long i've been like I WANT TO START DRAWING AGAIN and really all I need to do is draw. but it's so hard. i feel like i lost my sense of 'i know exactly what i want to make something feeling like'. looked very slowly thru the whole andrew hem artbook today and felt a little something something.  
  
at this pace of tattooing I actually wouldn't mind to continue to do it for awhile. but it's because i'm charging so much right now. and only one a day so far. but maybe it's ok because i'm just being like 'what would an expensive person charge for this', and then either charging that or capping to whatever budget someone gives if it's higher than it. but idk it feels weird. having a salaried job would take so much of that weirdness away because money would just show up in my bank acct every week and i wouldn't have to justify what i am charging for every single thing (to myself, clients are very nice about stuff like that).  
I ate three boxes of seaweed i think it was probably too much salt.  
I feel like the people i met right before leaving nyc made an outsized impact on me, and i didn't stick around long enough to get to know people that much more, and now i probably feel closer to those people than i should, just because I feel like i've been living in my head and in my memories way too much this past half year and that period right before I left was like when i was remembering how to make friends again. Kind of like being a weird lonely kid again and getting attached to internet people or summer camp people or whatever. I also feel like the last time i guested in nyc it was really awkward but i'm not sure if it's cause people were going through it at the time or because i was being awkward or because nobody was interested in becoming friends anymore. the impromptu food & hang with the old friends was really awesome tho, I feel like i'm mostly moving back to new york right now only to catch some more of that time before every one dissipates. I definitely feel like if I keep bouncing around I'll just become totally unable to feel connected to anywhere and settle down anymore.
