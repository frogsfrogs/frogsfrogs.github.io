<br>
I keep having dreams of you.  
<br>
Sometimes,  
we meet and we are friends again.  
<br>
Sometimes,  
we meet, and we are distant  
and it's awkward.  
<br>
We meet,  
and we become lovers.  
<br>
Sometimes.  
we meet.    &nbsp;&nbsp; and we say goodbye.  
<br>
never in any of these dreams do I hate you  
but when I wake up I find myself wishing I did.  
<br>
<!-- how lonely it is, to be a boy. 
how painful, to be called a girl. 
<br>
How much easier it is to pretend that I do, to pretend that I should, than to know that I don't have it in me to be angry with you.   -->
