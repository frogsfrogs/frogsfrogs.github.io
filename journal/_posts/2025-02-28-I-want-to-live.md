Thinking about the idea from the bit I wrote last night, I remember the point about 'the children' that the first essay in baedan made. It was something about 'the child' being vaguely synonymous to 'the future', and how it is used against us. The collective future and the individual future are pitted against each other, because our individual futures are held hostage as the price of struggle. I remember it felt like clarity, to realize that the trick to being brave was to accept that the future doesn't exist. I had this feeling that if I act in accordance to my beliefs, whatever individual outcome came to me would be okay. I would be able to accept it, because I would know that I did right by others and by myself. <br>
Recently though, being in bad health - suddenly I want to live. Or rather, I want to live well. Initially it felt wrong - I think I confused the feeling of self preservation with selfishness. It's hard to distinguish the two in life under the state though, because every way of living well within civ depends on the suffering of others. A year or 2 ago my answer would have been to just create friction any way I can. But in my life as it is now - the opportunity comes so infrequently, and I feel as if there is so little I am doing beyond staying afloat. The isolation that comes with disability is new to me, and I feel that this sort of loneliness is what stops political activation the most effectively (for me, at least).
