the (really kind) rheumatologist called me today while I was driving and told me my bloodwork is borderline positive for a lupus-specific antibody and also something something muscle something protein. she asked me if i was moving because my classes were going online. i felt human. i felt like a person.  
i felt bad that i didn't know how to be kind back in that moment, and that it was probably really noisy on the phone because i was driving.  

so, more bloodtests next week.  
i didn't expect anything to come of this.  
maybe it's lupus. that would suck, but i would be so relieved to know what this is.
