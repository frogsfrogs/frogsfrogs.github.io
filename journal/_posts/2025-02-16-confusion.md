I've never understood it when someone reacts to fear with anger. I guess this time it teaches me it's about feeling hurt that someone is afraid of you. As in 'I didn't do anything wrong, why are you afraid of me'. Or - 'why do you think I am not deserving of trust?' Or - 'Am I not human to you?' Or - 'Am I not deserving of the grace you grant others?'<br><br>
That hurt feeling I understand, but I don't understand the anger reflex. If you know someone is afraid, don't you want to reassure them? Most fear is not rational - although I know anger is not rational either - I wouldn't chastise him for some of his fears, wouldn't say, there's no basis in reality for that. My automatic response would not be anger. But I could easily hear it - don't be silly, why are you afraid of something so nonsense, just stop - as if it is so easy to stop being afraid, or a choice in the first place - but it's not the same - is it?<br><br>
Maybe it just comes down to - "Don't you see it's not fair that you are afraid of me?" and "Don't you see it's not fair that I am afraid of you?", and both blaming the other for making them feel that way. <br><br>
Trying to find other people's thoughts on this subject online, and many of the discussions I feel like just fall into tropes.<br><br>
It keeps replaying- clutching the end of the golf club, and dad gripping the handle, and m staring wide eyed - he didn't hit her - except now I know he did - and being so, so afraid even though he hadn't laid a finger on me since elementary school - because I knew I couldn't stop him from anything if it came down to it - and his expression, so disbelieving, so hurt, so enraged - and feeling so bad, so guilty for even thinking this of him, a bad daughter, a bad person - but now I know I was right all along - but feeling like i had to be brave because she was afraid and i was small but she was so much smaller - maybe I understand it more now, but I can't manage to be any less afraid, or more forgiving. <br><br>
And the complication of - they said some very cruel things, that I can't just move past. Anger doesn't come from air. I feel stuck. I feel obligated to make a judgement and act accordingly. I feel like I would be wronging everyone by not saying or doing anything differently. Everyone is giving me the benefit of the doubt, and I didn't do anything wrong. But if I don't act I am doing everything wrong, because several wrong things happened and I know silence is worse than the thing itself. <br>
These are just the invisible people in my head. I don't know what would actually happen if I talked to them about it. I don't know what I would say. I feel so resentful I can't invite them over. Why does it matter if he isn't here?? I know why it matters. But I am resentful anyways. I am also human.<br>
He is also human, and usually so, so gentle. But there's this vindictive streak. I haven't seen it before. I feel repulsed by it. It's alien to how my feelings work, and I know he regrets feeling that way as well. I don't know what to do with it. I want to run from it. I want to run from everything. I can't because my sinuses are infected again, and my head is spinning, and my leg burns. It's hard to leave the house and I can't invite them over. I feel childish, and petulant. I want everything to go away.
