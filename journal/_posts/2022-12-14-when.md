when???

thinking about when i was younger i wanted to *keep* everything so badly. knowing that everything would be gone only made it more precious, more urgent, more important to make records so that i could have it in my mind if not my eye
and then at some point my hand did not live up to my mind and so my mind did not live up to my eye any longer and i forgot to try or try or try  
and it feels so corny to even write let alone say but i forgot how to love the world, when i was a kid i did not love myself, not at all, but *i loved the world so much*. i loved everyone around me, i loved the kids that were my friends i loved the kids that looked down at me i loved with one breath even the kids that i hated with another, and i loved my parents even though they taught me to hate myself, and i loved in a way that was a desperation for things to never change and for everyone and everything to only ever be exactly what they were then. I guess somehow even though i hadn't been loving with any real knowledge of how brief everything is, that's where it came from. maybe it's the only thing the family I never really knew passed onto me, through doldrums through currents all the way across the sea from where I never met them. is how brief everything we have is, as it's ever been as long as we have been here. no matter how hard we collectively seem to be trying to forget that, as if submerging ourselves in mineral oil means that the death march that is living will never resume, as if our conductivity is not inevitable, as if the end of anything is not coming.

and now that i'm a little bit older and i understand that, where does that leave me? i'm scared to love, i'm scared to even remember love - it hasn't been that long except it also has, except that what does love even mean to me i've only ever understood as mutual consumption and construction and destruction and love, i miss loving someone and being loved and knowing their love, i know what i have now is good for me in the same way ginseng is i hate the taste of ginseng it makes me retch it makes me so resentful i can't catch my breath

i was walking the dog down 60th st today and felt like i was looking through people's windows for the first time even though ive lived here and walked this dog down the street like every night for the last 7 months. deja vu hit me with a sense of once-maybe-i-would-really-have-liked-to-be-able-to-draw-this-moon-and-this-building-and-this-fancy-plant-peeking-out-that-window except it was deja vu's ghosty cousin because i felt that want only from a timeline away and could not turnaround and look myself in the eye and admit that i didn't care to draw it down anymore. there's nothing here i want to record. there's nothing about this life here that i want to remember, even though this is my only life and i guess i'm living it, and what does that mean. i think i'm happy, i'm the physically healthiest i've been in years, my nails are unbitten for the first time in my life, i didn't even know that the materials of human nails became this hard and sturdy, but i don't feel any way about being here. i have friends that care about me and i care about them, except it feels like there's a void and only the barest breath of how we could maybe actually feel about one another makes it across, and we've all become conneuseuiers however the fuck you spell it fucking ratatouilles of tasting those breaths that we know deeply immediately what we mean to each other, or maybe might only could mean to each other, that i have decided that this is enough to constitute what passes muster as love right now. maybe some day my smell will come back or the vacuum we live in will be replaced by air instead of mineral oil and maybe one day i'll wake up and there will be someone i'm talking to who and their voice isn't a million miles away, and some one of these days i'll feel right as sunshine and i'll love the world that is right in front of me that i am literally sitting in right now but right now i am hiding somewhere in my mind and really i feel a little crazy that i typed all of this in the last 19 minutes straight like yesterday i just started writing on the back of an envelope on the train and just kept scribbling the whole ride back the same stream of consciousness stuff i guess im repressing something and its all gushing out huh
