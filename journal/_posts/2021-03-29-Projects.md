Really sad and tired today, yesterday too.  
I think I know which conversation set this off. And also doing bookings this weekend. I feel really sad when strangers say nice things to me about tattoos now. Feeling very alone. Makes me want to go to vermont to see a earlier than planned, but I don't want to use relationship to patch sadness.  
I think I need to completely get off instagram for a while. Maybe will ask a friend to change the password on my account and keep it a secret from me for a few months.
