maybe one day soon (or maybe in another world), we are all living together in an apartment building on Almond St. Maybe it's called 杏花居. I think you'd have a garden full of things you like to eat, and some flowers too. For the sake of this garden, you have a shouting match with the chipmunks every morning, or maybe with woodchucks or possums if we're in a city.  
<br>
Whenever I bring my little dog over, you say he looks like a rat. You probably feed him too many snacks and he gets fat.  
I come over and do my homework while you paint, or I come over and bike with you to the market. You keep as many birds and cats as you want, because there's enough space that 姥姥 never has to hear them.  
It's possible you strike up a friendship with an old man at the park - maybe you just nod and walk together a bit, and then go your separate ways.  
<br>
Maybe I don't live there all the time, but I come visit often and bring my friends. You say, 'aiya aiya' at how we all have so many tattoos, and act like you don't like any of them even though you think they're alright. I think you would get along with one of my cousins you've never met, and my childhood 闺蜜. My friends oo and ah at your paintings, and you are even gruffer with them because you get embarrassed.  
I'd probably rope some friends into regularly playing majiang with 姥姥, because we both love games - whenever she sweeps us, she'd be the sorest winner but give us all bean popsicles before we walk home. We probably fight a lot other than this.  
<br>
maybe in this world, I had somewhere to go as a kid, other than my parents' house. maybe you let me stay with you guys sometimes.  
maybe in this world, I got to know you more, and we don't get along for a bit. but you still let me come over and we draw together in the quiet afternoon, in your study room that gets too bright and warm when the sunlight is coming from the west.  
<br>
I hope this day comes soon. I miss you.
