A cat rows up in a boat made out of almonds and blown sugar. It holds up a paw and says: "4 元"。  
I turn out my pockets and check my shoes, but I only have 1 gang beng, so it says:  
"3 tears will do for the rest".  
I oblige and it grandly waves its paw: "请~~"。  
I step on the boat and it silently starts gliding into the dark ahead, the cat patiently rowing without a single ripple.
