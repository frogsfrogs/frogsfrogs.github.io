what does it take to have a clean room?  
<br>
my mother's rooms were never tidy  
not for longer than a moment.  
my grandfather's balcony was always covered in dust -  
dust so fine,  
and loved.  
<br>
i never saw the inside of my father's room.

<br>
how many lifetimes would it take  
to clean a house?  
<!-- and why should I  clean mine at all   -->
and for what reason  
should I clean mine at all  

<!-- cleaning, as devotion, or worship -->
