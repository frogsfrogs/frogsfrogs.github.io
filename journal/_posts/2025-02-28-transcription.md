Transcription of journalling last night <br>
<br>
ruminating on the fact that I am surprised I made it this far. I guess I'm not 30 yet, but 27 feels nearly there. It's starting to feel like I'm going to make it, unlike gugu & jiujiu. I've been living so frantically because on some level I was convinced I wouldn't. Now that I'm nearly there, I'm scared that I might be here a lot longer than that. What do I do now? <br>
<br>
Recently I've been feeling selfish with my time - I've been using it for myself, for things that are just for me. It feels hedonistic. Does everyone feel this way? I think so. I think everyone knows that life under the state is a virtual reality. But right now it feels so comforting to sink into it - even with the guilt that comes from returning to it after nearly finding a way out of it once. It feels like failure. <br>
<br>
It's funny a bit that a lot of people say getting sick radicalized them - I've been kind of feeling like getting sick de-radicalized me? Or at least it has removed a good deal of the level of participation that is possible for me. Maybe that's a cop out though. It's not impossible it is just harder. And to be honest I haven't been trying very hard. I think I'm relearning how to be an adult with these new limitations. I probably should be more creative about political involvement. It's hard because anarchist stuff is all so in-person. I wonder if I've grown out of the specific type of anarchism those people at tag are. It feels incompatible with the thought of "I have to live. I have to cope with being alive for a lot longer". Isn't it strange that when I was more healthy it was easier to throw away the idea of a future? Maybe it makes sense though, paired with the dreadful realization that death is a lot further than expected.
