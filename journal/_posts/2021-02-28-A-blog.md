**Hello World**  
I guess this is a secret blog because I'm not listing it on the main menu, but it's also pretty easy to guess the index.  
  
This is somewhat inspired by Wen Zeng's blog which I still regularly read. Not sure if that's weird since I don't know her that well, but I found it in college while looking at her photography, and kept reading it because I also really like backpacks?  
And just find the things she writes about interesting.  
  
The last time I went home, I found a bunch of journals from grade school. I remember writing diaries a few times a year as a kid, but never sticking with it. It surprised me to find so many.  
In college and in the 2 years since, I've also occasionally written, but they are all scattered in different notebooks that served many purposes. There are also some markdown files buried in different hard drives, and many many iphone notes stored throughout several icloud accounts, that are also journal entries / venting posts.  

Anyways, I thought if I finally start a blog that is internet based, maybe I will not lose it as easily. Though just typing that made me remember I started several blogspot blogs a few years ago with the same intent.  
  
I found my yu necklace again today in the washer, so I think that's a good omen.
