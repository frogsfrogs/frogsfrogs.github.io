Re-reading the journal entries from 2022 felt weird - I like the person I was back then more. My old writing is so much lovelier. More genuine. I think I was kinder. I think I believed in people more. Several of the childhood things I mentioned I no longer have any recollection of. I feel as if I am losing memories faster and faster. It's been less than 3 years. I guess a lot happened. I think being sick has made me more bitter. I think the brain fog has made me a worse writer. I think new york made me tired, and philly has made me lonely, and also harder. I wish I was soft again, and kind. I wish people were born more than once in a lifetime.
