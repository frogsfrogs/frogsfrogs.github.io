Re-reading the journal entries from 2022 felt weird - I like the person I was back then more. My old writing is so much lovelier. More genuine. I think I was kinder. I think I believed in people more. What happened? It's been less than 3 years. I guess a lot happened. I think being sick has made me more bitter. I think new york made me tired, and moving to philly made me lonely, and a bit harder. I want to be soft again, and kind.
