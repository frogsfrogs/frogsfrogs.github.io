Had an interesting and unexpected long chat with K last night - about family, and how people communicate (or don't) with each other - it being K of course the conversation started at "what do you think of square point of sale hardware"  
I felt really unsettled afterwards, and also this morning waking up. I realized I've never believed that anyone has good parents.  
Ben was my first friend who really seemed to feel like he had good parents, but then a few years later it turns out it was all buried trauma, and induced-hero worship, and actually his parents were terrible.  
When I met A's parents for the first time, I had an embarrassingly strong reaction to how nice and relaxed they were to be around. But with them, I am aware of A's interpersonal issues with them. I guess I am uncertain to what extent he might consider them 'good parents'.  
I'm pretty sure though, most everyone else I have ever been close to has parents that were dogshit to them in one important way or another. So I've always got the impression that there must be almost no one who feels like their parents raised them well.  
K clearly does though. And told me a few examples of unintuitive things that were actually really good parenting that their parents did.
