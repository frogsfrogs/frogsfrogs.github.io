i was convinced that i had killed someone  
he shot at me, and i shot back, and my roommate and i had to bury him somewhere in vermont, in a sandy patch amongst laurels on a green mountain. it was at night, and it was harder to dig a hole than we thought it would be, so it wasn't a very deep grave. It looked almost undisturbed when we were done, because of the sand.  
<br>
i woke up, and i was convinced this was something that had happened, and that they and i had both somehow forgotten. i kept going back to sleep to escape this reality.  
<br>
it was a tall man in a suit, with gray hair, a long face, droopy skin, and an unyielding expression. i knew who he was in the dream, and a middle age woman with a bobcut kept asking me if i had seen him.  
<br>
after many hours awake, it feels more like something from a dream, but still a little different - like something that did really happen on a different plane, even though that makes no sense  
<br>
the last time i woke up, i convinced myself it wasn't real - because my roommate would have never stopped being stressed out about it if it had actually happened, and they're clearly fine, so it never happened  
<br>
what a strange dream
