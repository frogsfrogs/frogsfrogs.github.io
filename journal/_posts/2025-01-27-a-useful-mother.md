What use is a person who cannot work?  
I've never wanted to be anything so much as I wanted to be useful.  
To whom do I want to be of use so badly?  
Who in the world do I want to be used by so badly  
<br>
There's nothing worse than being a useless person  
A use-less does not eat, drink, breathe without it being at the expense of someone else  
who is sponsoring you? it does not matter. it cannot possibly be deserved.  
<br>
does the eldest daughter ever feel deserving ?  
When I was 5 and you asked if I wanted a little sister  
I didn't know you were also asking if I wanted to be an eldest daughter  
I didn't know that this also meant being a mother  
Up the river and down the river both.  
<br>
I always thought it would have been so much better to be a son  
but I realize now, maybe only for me.  
<br>
I think about what it would mean to choose to be a mother now,  
and it feels like I already know - and I already failed.  
<br>
<br>
I had decided awhile ago, without realizing it, that I don't owe my mother a debt. Emotionally, anyways. That if anything, she owes me.  
That's wrong too though. I don't think there are debts. just a shitty world.  
I don't want to count debts, it feels like if I start counting I'll never stop.  
A good mother doesn't count what she's owed. She's perfectly caring and endlessly giving. It's the only kind of useful I've ever known.
