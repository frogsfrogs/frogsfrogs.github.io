Earlier today I read some reflections an acquaintance wrote about family they met on a trip last year;  
about the things different people in their family did, that they learned about.  
I felt envious, and was thinking about why - -  
. . .  
On my own recent first trip back to China in almost a decade, I discovered what my family is actually like.  
The times I had been there as a kid, I didn't understand. I was only happy to be there, happy to see lao lao and lao ye, bored at the many family gatherings with slightly familiar faces, but happy to run around and be a child, away from my parents.  
This time though, I think - -  
I think  
I come from a family of really meek people  
Viciously meek people  
Selfishly meek people.  
I think  
I love my lao ye, but maybe I can only love him as a grandpa.  
I don't know who he is / was as a person - I don't always want to know.  
The more I learned this time, the less I wanted to know. But also those were words from my mom & lao lao's mouths, so I feel even more uncertain. I wish I could ask him myself.  
I don't know how I feel about my lao lao. I think I love her, but it might just be attachment. What's the difference? When does someone become awful enougn that you stop loving them? What if you never stop loving them? What if you miss loving them, miss not understanding that they were awful?  
I think - -  
I'm ashamed of my family, and the things they've done, and the people they are.  
And equally, I feel ashamed even after I came home because  
It has struck me - that's what I was made from  
Something rotten, and sad.  
.  
I wish I had also brought back stories of brave things someone with my blood did 80 years ago, that I could see something in.  
I know that acquaintance probably has family issues too, but - man how I wish there was even a kernel of something good there.
