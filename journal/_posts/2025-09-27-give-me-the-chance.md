Hello again. Long time no see, my thoughts.  
It feels like my mind has been running away from itself for awhile now. Downward and inwards, circling insanity and apathy.  
And as usual, it has led to fantasies of escape. Some option other than the ones in front of me. Though unfortunately, at the bottom of this spiral there is nothing good. The ultimate escape has always been death.    
I keep thinking of leaving and going somewhere else. Often, somewhere else is north. Or Beijing. I picture what it would be like - it would feel like return - it would feel like I left the stasis of the last 2 years, and am finally earning everything back. I would exist, and be justified. I imagine living a different life, outside the shrinking walls of this apartment, and I keep telling myself - I can be good. I just have to be there, and not here. Please, somehow. Give me the chance to be good again.  
I struggle with the constant awareness that we always have a choice. Even under this world, that's true. It's weird - both capitalism and anarchism tells us this. Capitalism tells us that we are free, and that our circumstances are our own fault because all the choices are right in front of us. Anarchists tell me that individual choice is real, and no matter how shit the choice, there is another way out - and in choosing shit choices as rebellion, we are free. I don't want a shitty ending though. I don't want that for my friends. I still believe in negation, and nihilism, but I wish for something else. Everything feels like a circle, walking the dog around and around until both our hearts explode. I'm tired. Even when sometimes I wish to be where I was a few years ago, I can't pretend that wasn't a bad time too.
