I keep having dreams of you.  
Sometimes, we meet and we are friends again.  
Sometimes, we meet, and we are distant, and it's awkward.  
<br>
We are lovers.  
We meet, and we say goodbye.  
<br>
never in any of these dreams do I hate you  
but when I wake up I really wish I did.  
<br>
<!-- how lonely it is, to be a boy. 
how painful, to be called a girl. 
<br>
How much easier it is to pretend that I do, to pretend that I should, than to know that I don't have it in me to be angry with you.   -->
