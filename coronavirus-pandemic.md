### BELOW PRECAUTIONS ARE REQUIRED FOR APPOINTMENT  
<!-- <br> -->

- The building my studio is in requires that everybody is wearing a **KN-95** or **surgical mask** or **N-95**. Please come wearing one and keep it on for the duration of the appointment. If there is difficulty in obtaining one, I will have extra on hand.  
- Please **RESCHEDULE** if you are sick/someone you came into contact is sick. I will reschedule w/ no additional deposit or refund if necessary for this!!  
- Please **NO companions**, though they are welcome to accompany you up to the point of the building door.  
- Please come **ON TIME** as possible, rather than early or late, as appointments are spaced so that not too many people are at the studio at any time.  
- Please **EAT before** your appointment! Also please bring your own water bottle.  
- **I'm getting tested every 2 weeks** if not more frequently.  
- I will be wearing a KN-95 mask during our appointment.  
- Please get **tested** if you at all can! We will be spending an extended period of time together at a very close distance. If it is a great difficulty then I understand as the testing situation is so variable, but please exercise caution where you can.  
- There are 2 rooms in our studio. We will have at most 4 people (2 artists+clients) in the smaller room and 6 people in the big room (3 artists+clients), and the stations are spaced out.  
- We'll be cleaning thoroughly as normal at the studio, which is dousing everything in medical grade sterilants several times a day between clients. 

### Last note -  I have a chronic cough  
I've had it for 7 years. It is due to non-infectious reasons (stomach issues). On worse days I will have spurts of coughing, on better days it's barely there - I just want to disclose this beforehand as it understandably can make people nervous.
