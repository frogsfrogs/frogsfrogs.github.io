Here is a graphic that somewhat aligns with my intentions in offering sliding scale pricing.  
<br>
so for example, if I send a price quote that's $180-350 sliding scale, 180 is for the bottle on the far right, and 350 is for a bottle slightly left of the leftmost bottle, like if you really don't have to work.   
<br>
I mention this because I encounter a lot of kind clients who probably are somewhere in the middle but want to pay the highest end of the scale out of value for my work. I stopped doing sliding scale for awhile because it really wasn't working out how I wanted it to, but I would like to return to offering it and being more systematic about it.  
<br>
This image is very general, I definitely would never nitpick at people about this and I absolutely will never tell you you are paying too low on the scale. I'm just putting my thoughts here so like, if the lower part of the scale is what's in budget for you, please don't feel bad about taking me up on it!
