Books are currently: **CLOSED**  
Please join mailing list to receive the booking form link when books open. I will open books within the next week or two for Jan 2022 in LA. I originally said I was going to be here until May but now I am not sure how long I will stay in LA because it is looking like the classes I moved here to take are going to move online oops.  

I will announce any new guest spots by email on the mailing list!  
<br><br>
**AVAILABLE** 
(books are closed, just leaving this page up for reference)  
= Listed sizes are preferred, but usually I'm down to do a bit bigger or smaller. 2 inches is the smallest I will go though.  
= Pricing is an estimate may vary depending on placement and sizing. I will provide exact pricing in my email response to your booking form. Full colorwork and blackwork take a longer time for good quality, this is why the pricing for them is higher.   
= Designs will be crossed out if they become unavailable. Each tattooed up to twice (but usually only once). If this is something you care about please put a note in the booking form.  
= Will consider all placements but I will favor arm/leg/back placements. I have some injuries that make it difficult for me to book placements that require me to stand/hover.  
= Please read <a href="/red-seal">this note</a> before requesting any flash design marked with a red seal stamp.  
  
(on mobile you should be able to just zoom in on this page)
