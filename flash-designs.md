Books are currently: **CLOSED**  
Please join mailing list to receive the booking form link when books open. I will open books within the next week or two for Jan 2022 in LA. I originally said I was going to be here until May but now I am not sure how long I will stay in LA because it is looking like the classes I moved here to take are going to move online oops.  

I will announce any new guest spots by email on the mailing list!  
<br><br>
**AVAILBLE** (books are closed, just leaving this page up for reference)  
= Listed sizes are preferred/minimum. Can be bigger. Will not do smaller.  
= Pricing is for listed size, might vary a little depending on placement.  
= Each design tattooed once, I will mark designs 'TAKEN' in the description as they get booked. 'tentatively TAKEN' means I replied to someone's request for a piece but they haven't booked it in yet.   
= Will consider all placements but probably will favor arm/leg/back/chest placements over side/rib/sternum.  
= Please read <a href="/red-seal">this note</a> before requesting any flash design marked with a red seal stamp.  
  
(on mobile you should be able to just zoom in on this page)
