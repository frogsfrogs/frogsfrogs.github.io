## Custom Designs  
  
I will be accepting some custom requests whenever I have the capacity to.  Please email me at onion.ttt@gmail.com if you are interested in a custom design : )  
<br>
Please put “Custom Tattoo Request” in the email subject line.  
<br>
In your email, let me know:  
<br>
- Details about the design you’d want  
- Style  
- BW or color  
- Size in inches (please check with a physical ruler rather than eyeballing it)  
- Placement  
- Any reference images.  
<br>

I will let you know if I’m down to do the project with you, along with price quote and scheduling link. 

Custom designs are available to view at the time of the appointment - happy to make any desired adjustments at that time.  

I am intentionally going to be going through and responding to custom requests slower so as to not burn out on administrative work as I have in the past, so if you must know by a specific date please put that in the email. It may generally take me up to a few weeks to get back to you. (to be totally honest, sometimes a month or two)

Thanks for your interest in working with me! : )
