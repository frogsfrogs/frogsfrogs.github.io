<br>

<!-- ## Custom Designs  
  
Please read through the Booking Info page linked above before filling out the form - thanks!  
<br>
<br> -->
## Here are some custom design categories you can choose from:  

**Lucky Knots**  
* <a href="/lucky-knots">-here-</a> are some pieces from this series I have done in the past.  
<br>

**Shoals**  
* <a href="/shoals">-here-</a> are some pieces from this series I have done in the past.  
<br>

**Mythology**  
* <a href="/mythology">-here-</a> are some pieces from this series I have done in the past.  
<br>

**BW Realism**  
* <a href="/bw-realism">-here-</a> are some pieces from this series I have done in the past.  

<br>
I will prioritize custom requests of the the above categories, and also flash appointments, but I also take open-ended custom requests!  
In the custom booking form, you can also select **"other"** for the category to submit an open-ended request about any tattoo design you are interested in.  
A note on requests that draw from cultural imagery - <a href="/red-seal">Link</a>  

I **cannot tattoo ribs or side (anything between hip bone and armpit), or likely sternum** due to my back issues, I am unable to sustain the posture needed to tattoo this area.  
I will include a price quote in my email response to your booking form, based on size/placement/style.

<!-- I will be accepting some custom requests whenever I have the capacity to.  Please email me at onion.ttt@gmail.com if you are interested in a custom design : )  
<br>
**Some things I would extra love to work on:** flowers! plants! mythology! birds! human figures!  
Some things I probably won't do: tigers, snakes with lots of individual scales  
<br>
Please put “Custom Tattoo Request” in the email subject line.  
<br>
In your email, let me know:  
<br>
- Details about the design you’d want  
- Style  
- BW or color  
- Size in inches (please check with a physical ruler rather than eyeballing it)  
- Placement  
- Any reference images.  
- Are you local to NYC or coming from out of town? (this does not affect your booking, it is useful information to me when dealing with rescheduling and such)
<br>


I will let you know if I’m down to do the project with you, along with price quote and scheduling link. 

Custom designs are available to view at the time of the appointment - happy to make any desired adjustments at that time.  

I am intentionally going to be going through and responding to custom requests slower so as to not burn out on administrative work as I have in the past, so if you must know by a specific date please put that in the email. It may generally take me up to a few weeks to get back to you. (to be totally honest, sometimes a month or two)

Thanks for your interest in working with me! : ) -->
