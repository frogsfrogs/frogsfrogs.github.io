**FLASHBOOK**  
  
= List sizes are preferred, but feel free to ask in the form if you want a different size.  
= All flash placements: arm/leg/back. other placements, maybe.  
= I **cannot tattoo ribs or side (anything between hip bone and armpit), or likely sternum** due to my back issues, I am unable to sustain the posture needed to tattoo this area.  
= I will include a price quote in my email response to your booking form, based on size/placement/style.  
<br>
= ***flash is repeatable, but I will probably retire designs if I have tattooed them multiple times***  
<br>

(on mobile you should be able to just zoom in on this page)
