<!-- *-  Thank you everyone who submitted a booking request for Feb/Mar 2023! I will be replying to these over the next week or two. edit 3/18/23 - Hi, had personal life difficulties/events last month, and so I was not able to finish replying to booking replies. I am slowly working on it now that things are good again, thank you so much for your patience. -*  -->

**FLASHBOOK**  
  
= List sizes are preferred, but feel free to ask in the form if you want a different size.  
= All flash placements: arm/leg/back. other placements, maybe.  
= I **cannot tattoo ribs or side (anything between hip bone and armpit), or likely sternum** due to my back issues, I am unable to sustain the posture needed to tattoo this area.  
= I will include a price quote in my email response to your booking form, based on size/placement/style.  
= flash is repeatable  
<br>
<br>
(on mobile you should be able to just zoom in on this page)
