**A note on designs that draw from cultural imagery (flash marked with red seal stamp)**  
<br>
This is the seal image (you can ignore anything else):  
![red-seal](/images/red-seal.png)  
<br>
- As an artist I would really prefer to tattoo certain designs of mine that draw from Chinese cultural imagery to people who have personal cultural connection to it (I put my red seal stamp on these flashes). This could mean you are of Chinese/Taiwanese descent, or other specific personal context. I also acknowledge that these imagery overlap with styles and subject matters of other cultures (for example, chinese knots and korean norigae are quite similar), so I'm not super picky about this.  
<br>
- I just ask that you judge for yourself whether you have such a connection. I will not question your interpretation of this note, nor will I ask for any explanation; I just would like you to think about it for a moment. If you feel comfortable getting the tattoo after reading this note, then I feel comfortable making it for you, as you know best where you're coming from. Sorry this is both wordy and vague, best draft I could write.  
- Just **include the word 'frogger'** in the note box on my booking form so that I know you've read this, if you are requesting one of these designs.  
<br>
- Otherwise, I would respectfully ask that you choose a different flash piece / custom concept if you are interested in my work! I hope you can understand and respect my feelings on this.
