**A note on designs that draw from cultural imagery (flash marked with red seal + applicable customs)**  
<br>
This is what the seal looks like:

<br>
- As an artist I would really prefer to tattoo certain designs of mine that draw from Chinese cultural imagery to people who have personal cultural connection to it (I put my red seal stamp on these flashes). This could mean you are of Chinese/Taiwanese descent, or other specific personal context. I also acknowledge that these imagery overlap with styles and subject matters of other cultures (for example, chinese knots and korean norigae are quite similar), so I'm not super picky about this.  
<br>
- If you feel connected to my pieces, I just ask that you judge for yourself. I will not question your interpretation, nor will I ask for explanation; I just ask that you think about it for a moment. If you feel comfortable getting the tattoo after reading this note, then I feel comfortable making it for you, as you know best where you're coming from. Sorry this is both wordy and vague! Best I could come up with. 
- Just **include the word 'frogger'** in the note box on my booking form so that I know you've read this, if you are making this kind of tattoo request.  
<br>
- Otherwise, I would respectfully ask that you choose a different flash piece / custom concept if you are interested in my work! I hope you can understand and respect my feelings on this.
