**A note on designs that draw from cultural imagery**  
<br>
This is the seal image (this note only refers to flash designs marked with the seal)(or custom requests that draw from cultural imagery):  
![red-seal](/images/red-seal.png)  
<br>
- I prefer to tattoo designs that draw from cultural imagery or iconography, to people who have a personal connection to that imagery. Up to your judgement what that connection is or means, I won't ask or anything, just please think about it for a moment. If you feel comfortable getting the tattoo after reading this note, then I feel comfortable making it for you, as you know best where you're coming from.  
- This is coming from my discomfort as an artist (also as a human being) with orientalist vibes I get sometimes.  
- this is also a request for reflection on custom design requests that draw from cultural imagery  
- Just **include the word 'frogger'** in the note box on my booking form so that I know you've read this, if you are requesting one of these designs.  
<br>
- Otherwise, I would respectfully ask that you choose a different flash piece / custom concept if you are interested in my work! I hope you can understand and respect my feelings on this.
