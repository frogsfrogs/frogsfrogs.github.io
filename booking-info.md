Books are currently: CLOSED   
<br>
I closed the form early because I got over like 6x as many requests as slots I have.  
Thank you everyone who submitted a booking form! Please look out for a response from me sometime this week.  
<br>
Please read this FAQ before submitting a booking form.

<br>

**Booking**  
<br>
- I only book tattoos through the booking form. Please do not email me with booking requests.  
- New flash and booking form opening goes out by email to my mailing list.  Only leftover flash + filling cancellation spots goes out on my instagram.  
- [You can join my mailing list at this link](https://eepurl.com/hgUiO9)  
- My tattoo work can be viewed [here](https://instagram.com/sleep.on.frogs)  
<br>

**Flash Designs**  
- No flash designs currently available. I will send out new flash sometime in the next few weeks.   
- Please read <a href="/red-seal">this note</a> before requesting any flash design marked with a red seal stamp.  
<br>

**Custom Designs**  
- At this time, I am taking custom tattoo requests for **freehand black linework designs only**. Freehand means that I draw the design directly onto your skin at the appointment (therefore design will not be shown beforehand as there is nothing to show).   
- The <a href="/red-seal">note I mention above</a> applies to custom designs as well.  
<!-- - Custom designs will be available to view **at the time of the appointment**. I totally understand if this is a dealbreaker, as I know for some this is not comfortable. I cannot make the promise to send drafts earlier however. Adjustments can be made to the design at the time of the appointment! -->  
<br>

**Color Tests**  
- Color tests available free of charge (after a project is accepted and you intend to get the tattoo that booking period but before you put down a deposit). Color tests are not required.  
<br>

**Consultation**  
- I do not offer these right now, especially not with the pandemic and all. Everything happens over email until the appointment.  
<br>

**Cover-ups**  
- I usually do not do cover-ups, but occasionally I will take on this kind of project. Usually the design has to be a lot bigger than the old one to be effective.  
- Adding onto / 'evolving' an old tattoo also I rarely do.  
<br>

**Pricing**  
- I will send you the price quote in my email response to your booking request. Usually it is flat rate, sometimes hourly or day rate if it is a big project. <!--  For more expensive projects I often send a sliding scale quote. If you are uncertain about sliding scale pricing <a href="/sliding-scale">please see this note about it</a>.   -->
- If it is out of budget, let me know I will send you a sliding scale pricing.    
- Current rates will be listed in the booking form. My rate honestly goes up and down a bit, depending on my work situation in a particular month.  
- My appointment minimum is $150.  
- **Tips not required** because I set my own prices and I currently work at a collective space so it's flat rent, the studio doesn't take a cut.  
- There is a $50 deposit to book the appointment, it goes towards the cost of the tattoo. Usually nonrefundable, but for COVID reasons I am flexible (like you are sick, or may have been infected, or need to take care of somebody b/c of COVID).  
- Please try to let me know as soon as possible if you need to cancel or reschedule - if I have time to fill the spot and I succeed I will refund the deposit always. If not, I'll still always apply it towards your tattoo if we do it later.  
<br>

**Touchups**  
- I do 1 free touchup within the first 6 months. After that I still do touchups for a fee (fee depends on the scope/scale). Book touchups using the normal booking form.  
- Please let your tattoo heal at least 1 month before getting it touched up.  
<br>

**Location + Miscellaneous**  
- I'm at Moonrise Tattoo Collective([insta](https://instagram.com/moonrise.tattoo)); it's right off the Morgan L stop.  
- If you can't be around dogs for any reason let me know in the booking form - my studiomate's friendly dog hangs out in the studio sometimes, but she can be not there for our tattoo session.  
- Also if you can't be around anything else, whether allergy things or scents or loud music or anything, just let me know.  
<br>

## COVID-19 PRECAUTIONS - REQUIRED FOR APPOINTMENT  
<br>

- The building my studio is in requires that everybody is wearing a KN-95 or surgical mask or N-95. Please come wearing one and keep it on for the duration of the appointment. If there is difficulty in obtaining one, I will have extra on hand.  
- Please RESCHEDULE if you are sick/someone you came into contact is sick. I will reschedule w/ no additional deposit or refund if necessary for this!!  
- Please NO companions, though they are welcome to accompany you up to the point of the building door.  
- Please try to come ON TIME - best not to be early or late, as appointments are spaced so that not too many people are at the studio at any time.  
- Please EAT before your appointment! Also please bring your own water bottle.  
- I'm getting tested every 2 weeks if not more frequently.  
- Please get **tested** if you at all can! We will be spending an extended period of time together at a very close distance. If it is a great difficulty then I understand as the testing situation is so variable, but please exercise caution where you can.  
- There are 2 rooms in our studio. We will have at most 4 people (2 artists+clients) in the smaller room and 6 people in the big room (3 artists+clients), and the stations are spaced out.  
- We'll be cleaning thoroughly as normal at the studio, which is dousing everything in medical grade sterilants several times a day between clients. 

### Last note -  I have a chronic cough  
I've had it for 7 years. It is due to non-infectious reasons (stomach issues). On worse days I will have spurts of coughing, on better days it's barely there - I just want to disclose this beforehand as it understandably can make people nervous.
