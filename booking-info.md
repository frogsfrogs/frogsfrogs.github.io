### How to Book  
<br>
- Once every few months, I will email out to my mailing list when my books open. At that time a link to a tattoo booking form will appear on this website. Some time later I will put the link in my instagram bio link as well.  
- New flash posted here when books open. I will keep this page updated with availability. If I have last minute openings or cancellations come up, I will post on my instagram story.  
- [You can join my mailing list at this link](https://molymoli.substack.com/)  
- My tattoo work can be viewed [here](https://instagram.com/molymoli_) on instagram.

<!-- - I am not booking any new custom appointments this month.   -->
<!-- - [Click here for Custom Booking instructions.](https://frogsfrogs.github.io/custom-booking)  --> 

<!-- I will be accepting some custom requests whenever I have the capacity to.  Please email me at onion.ttt@gmail.com if you are interested in a custom design : )  
<br>
Please put “Custom Tattoo Request” in the email subject line.  
<br>
In your email, let me know:  
<br>
- Details about the design you’d want  
- Style  
- BW or color  
- Size in inches (please check with a physical ruler rather than eyeballing it)  
- Placement  
- Any reference images.  
<br>

I will let you know if I’m down to do the project with you, along with price quote and scheduling link. 

Custom designs are available to view at the time of the appointment - happy to make any desired adjustments at that time.  

I am intentionally going to be going through and responding to custom requests slower so as to not burn out on administrative work as I have in the past, so if you must know by a specific date please put that in the email. It may generally take me up to a few weeks to get back to you. (to be totally honest, sometimes a month or two)

Thanks for your interest in working with me! : ) -->

<!-- - Custom designs will be available to view **at the time of the appointment**. Happy to make any desired adjustment day-of.  
- Designs that flow around the body like shoals of fish, incense smoke, or rivers may work better as freehand. We can discuss this when you submit a booking form.   -->  
<!-- - Not currently booking custom tattoos, flash only.  
<br> -->

<!-- **Color Tests**  
- Color tests available free of charge (after a project is accepted and you intend to get the tattoo that booking period but before you put down a deposit). Color tests are not required.  
<br> -->
<!-- Complexion  
- I tattoo all complexions.  
- I fully trust that people know best what they want on their own bodies.  
<br> -->

<!-- **Consultation**  
- Everything happens over email until the appointment.  
<br> -->
<br>
<br>

**Cover-ups**  
<!-- - I usually do not do cover-ups, but occasionally I will take on this kind of project. Usually the design has to be a lot bigger than the old one to be effective. -->  
- Will consider blast overs but not currently doing cover-ups.  
<!-- - Adding onto / 'evolving' an old tattoo I usually also do not do.  -->   
<br>

**Pricing**  

<!-- - I will send you the price quote in my email response to your booking request. Usually it is flat rate, sometimes hourly or day rate if it is a big project. For more expensive projects I often send a sliding scale quote. If you are uncertain about sliding scale pricing <a href="/sliding-scale">please see this note about it</a>.  
- If it is out of budget, let me know I will send you a sliding scale pricing.    
- Current rates will be listed in the booking form. My rate honestly goes up and down a bit, depending on my work situation in a particular month.  
- My appointment minimum is $150.   -->
<!-- - I will send you the price quote in my email response to your booking request. Usually it is flat rate, sometimes hourly or session rate if it is a big project.   -->
<!-- - Currently I am tattooing on Sundays.  
- Booking only by half-day or full-day sessions. Half-day (2ish hrs) is 350. Full-day (4ish hrs) is 650.  
- (the 2 or 4 hrs is tattooing time, not including stenciling/drawing/setting up etc)  
- You can get as many tattoos as you'd like, that fit in that session length.  --> 
<!-- - For a rough idea, my appointment minimum is 150, so simplest designs are around 150, small-medium blackwork only designs 200-300, small-med color/bw shading 250-400, medium-larger full bw shading/color 400-800. My prices have gone up because I've developed a ton of joint issues by tattooing too much and too intensely the last few years so I have increased my rates so that I can work a manageable amount instead of quitting all together. I'm really sorry that this will likely price out some people I might've been able to work with otherwise, I hope to return to sliding scale in the future when I am settled down in one place again.   -->
- I will send you the price quote in my email response to your booking request. Usually it is flat rate.  
If it is out of budget, let me know and I will see if we can make it work.  
- Tip is not at all required or expected, though appreciated  
- Cash only  
- Appointment minimum 150 (if it's a really simple one I'm happy to do 2 for the minimum).  
<br>

<!-- **Touchups**  
- After your tattoo heals, if anything heals out or there are any other fixes you'd like, I offer one free touchup within the first 6 months. After that, touchup fee depends on the scope/scale. I am happy to do touch-ups, but please only book a touchup if there is something specific you would like me to touchup.  
- Please let your tattoo heal at least 1 month before getting a touchup. 
- Email me at onion.ttt@gmail.com if you would like to book a touchup. Please include a well-lit, clear photo of the healed tattoo in your email, and a short description of what you'd like me to touchup.  
<br> -->

**Healing after Vaccine**  
- IF YOU ARE GETTING/HAVE GOTTEN THE COVID-19 VACCINE OR BOOSTERS: please wait at least 1.5 weeks after your last shot before getting your tattoo with me. There is a distinct possibility of poor tattoo healing or pseudo-allergic reactions with tattoos done directly after receiving a vaccine shot, due to increased immune system reactivity.  
<br>

**Deposits, Cancellations, Rescheduling**  
- There is a nonrefundable $50 deposit to book the appointment, it goes towards the cost of the tattoo.  
- Please let me know as soon as possible if you need to reschedule/cancel.  
<!-- - if I have time to fill the spot and I succeed I will either apply the deposit towards your future appointment if you reschedule, or refund the deposit if you cancel (usually if you can give me 3-4 days notice). This is not guaranteed though, because I can't always fill it, so please consider the deposit generally nonrefundable.   -->
<!-- - **As I am currently traveling, it is difficult to accommodate reschedules at this time (though I will try).** -->
- If you need to back out last minute, please please just shoot me an email and let me know, I won't be mean about it or anything! Much better to know than to be waiting around.  
<br>

**Location + Dog + Miscellaneous**  
- I am currently in Philadelphia, still figuring out a space to work at.  
- I do not take appointments on Saturdays.  

- I have a small friendly dog who is often present during the tattoo. Let me know in the notebox on the booking form if you have allergies or other dog issues. I can put him in a baby fence during the tattoo, or leave him at home if possible.  
- The place I tattoo is up 3.5 flights of narrow stairs & there are no elevators. I do not have an alternate accessible space to work out of right now unfortunately.  
<br>

## COVID STUFF  
- <h4 style="color: #B80000;">Please come wearing a mask covering nose & mouth and keep it on for the duration of the appointment.</h4>  

<!-- 
- <h4 style="color: #B80000;">Please take a rapid test night before or morning-of our appointment</h4>  
- If it comes back positive, let me know and I will do my best to reschedule you later on free of additional charge, or if that is not possible I will refund your deposit. No hard feelings or anything if so.  
<br>
**I ask that you please honor this as I have increased risk of complications from COVID.**   -->
- Please **RESCHEDULE** if you are feeling sick.  
- Please **no companions**.  
- Please **EAT before** your appointment! Also please bring your own water bottle.
