Books are currently: **CLOSED**  
Please join mailing list to receive the booking form link when books open. I will open books within the next week or two for Jan 2022 in LA. I originally said I was going to be here until May but now I am not sure how long I will stay in LA because it is looking like the classes I moved here to take are going to move online oops.

**Please read this FAQ before submitting a booking form, thank you!**

**How to Book**  
<br>
- Once to twice a month, I will email out to my mailing list when my books open. At that time a link to a tattoo booking form will appear on this website. Some time later I will put the link in my instagram bio link as well.  
- I only book tattoos through the booking form. Please do not email or DM with booking requests.  
- New flash posted here when books open. I will keep both this page & instagram flash highlight updated with availability. If I have last minute openings or cancellations come up, I will post on instagram story.    
- [You can join my mailing list at this link](http://eepurl.com/hD-omr)  
- My tattoo work can be viewed [here](https://instagram.com/molymoli_) on instagram.  
<br>

**Flash Designs**  
- [Flash Designs can be viewed here.](https://frogsfrogs.github.io/flash-designs)   
<!-- - Flash Designs will be posted here when books open. -->
- Please read <a href="/red-seal">this note</a> before requesting any flash design marked with a red seal stamp.  
<br>

**Custom Designs**  
- At this time, I am not taking booking requests for custom designs.    

<!-- - At this time, I am taking custom tattoo requests for **freehand black linework designs only**. Freehand means that I draw the design directly onto your skin at the appointment (therefore design will not be shown beforehand as there is nothing to show).   
- The <a href="/red-seal">note I mention above</a> applies to custom designs as well. -->
<!-- - Custom designs will be available to view **at the time of the appointment**. I totally understand if this is a dealbreaker, as I know for some this is not comfortable. I cannot make the promise to send drafts earlier however. Adjustments can be made to the design at the time of the appointment! -->  
<br>

<!-- **Color Tests**  
- Color tests available free of charge (after a project is accepted and you intend to get the tattoo that booking period but before you put down a deposit). Color tests are not required.  
<br> -->
<!-- Complexion  
- I tattoo all complexions.  
- I fully trust that people know best what they want on their own bodies.  
<br> -->

**Consultation**  
- Everything happens over email until the appointment.  
<br>

**Cover-ups**  
<!-- - I usually do not do cover-ups, but occasionally I will take on this kind of project. Usually the design has to be a lot bigger than the old one to be effective. -->  
- Not doing cover-ups right now. Will consider blast overs.  
- Adding onto / 'evolving' an old tattoo I usually also do not do.    
<br>

**Pricing**  

<!-- - I will send you the price quote in my email response to your booking request. Usually it is flat rate, sometimes hourly or day rate if it is a big project. For more expensive projects I often send a sliding scale quote. If you are uncertain about sliding scale pricing <a href="/sliding-scale">please see this note about it</a>.  
- If it is out of budget, let me know I will send you a sliding scale pricing.    
- Current rates will be listed in the booking form. My rate honestly goes up and down a bit, depending on my work situation in a particular month.  
- My appointment minimum is $150.   -->
- Prices are listed on the flash page, may vary a bit depending on placement/sizing, I will give you an exact quote in my email reply to your booking form.  
- Tips not expected, the price you are quoted is the total cost of the tattoo.  
<br>

**Touchups**  
- One free touchup within the first 6 months. After that touchup fee depends on the scope/scale. Email me at jessowang.tattoo@gmail.com if you would like to book a touchup.  
- Please let your tattoo heal at least 1 month before getting it touched up.  
<br>

**Healing after Vaccine**  
- IF YOU ARE GETTING/HAVE GOTTEN THE COVID-19 VACCINE OR BOOSTERS: please wait at least 1.5 weeks after your final shot before getting your tattoo with me. There is a distinct possibility of poor tattoo healing or pseudo-allergic reactions with tattoos done directly after receiving a vaccine shot, due to increased immune system reactivity.  
<br>

**Deposits, Cancellations, Rescheduling**  
- There is a $50 deposit to book the appointment, it goes towards the cost of the tattoo.  
- Please try to let me know as soon as possible if you need to cancel - if I have time to fill the spot and I succeed I will refund the deposit always (usually if you can give me 3-4 days notice). If not, I'll still always apply it towards your tattoo if we do it later.  
- **As I am currently traveling, it is difficult to accommodate reschedules at this time (though I will try).**
- If for any reason you need to back out last minute, please please just shoot me an email and let me know, I won't be mad! It just really sucks to be sitting around waiting for an hour thinking someone is going to show up and then I also can't fill it.  
<br>

**Location + Miscellaneous**  
- Currently in Los Angeles - most likely will be guesting out of various spaces around Ktown and DTLA.  
<br>

## COVID-19 PRECAUTIONS POLICIES - REQUIRED FOR APPOINTMENT  
<br>

- **Please come wearing a mask covering nose & mouth and keep it on for the duration of the appointment.** Ideally a KN-95 or N-95 mask, but if there is difficulty in obtaining one, I will have extra on hand.  
- **Regardless if you are vaccinated or not, please get PCR tested within 72 hours of our appointment** and if it comes back positive let me know immediately and I will do my best to reschedule you later on free of additional charge, or if that is not possible I will refund your deposit. No hard feelings or anything if so. I ask that you please honor this as I am high risk (currently going through diagnosis of possible autoimmune disease).  
- Please **RESCHEDULE** if you are sick/someone you came into contact is sick. I will reschedule w/ no additional deposit or refund if necessary for this!!  
- Please **NO companions**, though they are welcome to accompany you up to the point of the building door.  
- Please **EAT before** your appointment! Also please bring your own water bottle.  

### Last note -  I have a chronic cough  
I've had it for 7 years. It is due to non-infectious reasons (stomach issues). On worse days I will have spurts of coughing, on better days it's barely there - I just want to disclose this beforehand as it understandably can make people nervous. I will be masked up the whole time of the appointment.
