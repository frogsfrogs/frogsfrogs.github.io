**How to Book**  
<br>
- Once to twice a month, I will email out to my mailing list when my books open. At that time a link to a tattoo booking form will appear on this website. Some time later I will put the link in my instagram bio link as well.  
- I only book tattoos through the booking form. Please do not email or DM with booking requests.  
- New flash posted here when books open. I will keep both this page updated with availability. If I have last minute openings or cancellations come up, I will post on my instagram story.    
- [You can join my mailing list at this link](o)  
- My tattoo work can be viewed [here](https://instagram.com/molymoli_) on instagram.  
<br>

**Flash Designs**  
<!-- - [Flash Designs can be viewed here.](https://frogsfrogs.github.io/flash-designs)    -->
- [Flash Designs can be viewed here.](https://frogsfrogs.github.io/flash-book)  
<!-- - Flash Designs will be posted here when books open. -->
<!-- - Please read <a href="/red-seal">this note</a> before requesting any flash design marked with a red seal stamp.   -->
<br>

**Custom Designs**  
- Custom designs will be available to view **at the time of the appointment**. Happy to make any desired adjustment day-of.  
- Designs that flow around the body like shoals of fish, incense smoke, or rivers may work better as freehand. We can discuss this when you submit a booking form.  
<br>

<!-- **Color Tests**  
- Color tests available free of charge (after a project is accepted and you intend to get the tattoo that booking period but before you put down a deposit). Color tests are not required.  
<br> -->
<!-- Complexion  
- I tattoo all complexions.  
- I fully trust that people know best what they want on their own bodies.  
<br> -->

<!-- **Consultation**  
- Everything happens over email until the appointment.  
<br> -->

**Cover-ups**  
<!-- - I usually do not do cover-ups, but occasionally I will take on this kind of project. Usually the design has to be a lot bigger than the old one to be effective. -->  
- Not doing cover-ups right now. Will consider blast overs.  
<!-- - Adding onto / 'evolving' an old tattoo I usually also do not do.  -->   
<br>

**Pricing & Availability**  

<!-- - I will send you the price quote in my email response to your booking request. Usually it is flat rate, sometimes hourly or day rate if it is a big project. For more expensive projects I often send a sliding scale quote. If you are uncertain about sliding scale pricing <a href="/sliding-scale">please see this note about it</a>.  
- If it is out of budget, let me know I will send you a sliding scale pricing.    
- Current rates will be listed in the booking form. My rate honestly goes up and down a bit, depending on my work situation in a particular month.  
- My appointment minimum is $150.   -->
<!-- - I will send you the price quote in my email response to your booking request. Usually it is flat rate, sometimes hourly or session rate if it is a big project.   -->
- Currently I am tattooing on Sundays.  
- Booking only by half-day or full-day sessions. Half-day (2ish hrs) is 350. Full-day (4ish hrs) is 650.  
- (the 2 or 4 hrs is tattooing time, not including stenciling/drawing/setting up etc)  
- You can get as many tattoos as you'd like, that fit in that session length.  
<!-- - For a rough idea, my appointment minimum is 150, so simplest designs are around 150, small-medium blackwork only designs 200-300, small-med color/bw shading 250-400, medium-larger full bw shading/color 400-800. My prices have gone up because I've developed a ton of joint issues by tattooing too much and too intensely the last few years so I have increased my rates so that I can work a manageable amount instead of quitting all together. I'm really sorry that this will likely price out some people I might've been able to work with otherwise, I hope to return to sliding scale in the future when I am settled down in one place again.   -->
- Tips not expected.  
- Cash only  
<br>

**Touchups**  
- One free touchup within the first 6 months. After that touchup fee depends on the scope/scale. Email me at jessowang.tattoo@gmail.com if you would like to book a touchup.  
- Please let your tattoo heal at least 1 month before getting it touched up.  
<br>

**Healing after Vaccine**  
- IF YOU ARE GETTING/HAVE GOTTEN THE COVID-19 VACCINE OR BOOSTERS: please wait at least 1.5 weeks after your final shot before getting your tattoo with me. There is a distinct possibility of poor tattoo healing or pseudo-allergic reactions with tattoos done directly after receiving a vaccine shot, due to increased immune system reactivity.  
<br>

**Deposits, Cancellations, Rescheduling**  
- There is a nonrefundable deposit to book the appointment, it goes towards the cost of the tattoo. Deposit amount is $50 for half-day session, $100 for full-day session.  
- Please try to let me know as soon as possible if you need to cancel - if I have time to fill the spot and I succeed I will refund the deposit always (usually if you can give me 3-4 days notice).  
<!-- - **As I am currently traveling, it is difficult to accommodate reschedules at this time (though I will try).** -->
- If for any reason you need to back out last minute, please please just shoot me an email and let me know, I won't be mad! Much better to know than to come to the studio waiting around.  
<br>

**Location + Miscellaneous**  
- Currently in Brooklyn until at least May. Working at private studio in Broadway-Junction area.

## COVID-19 PRECAUTIONS POLICIES - REQUIRED FOR APPOINTMENT  
<br>

- <h4 style="color: #B80000;">Please come wearing a KN-95 or N-95 mask covering nose & mouth and keep it on for the duration of the appointment.</h4> If there is difficulty in obtaining one, I will have extra on hand.  
- <h4 style="color: #B80000;">Please get tested for COVID within a few days before our appointment, regardless if you are vaccinated or not</h4> Ideally PCR but I realize the results might not come back soon enough, so rapid test morning-of or day-before is find too!  
- If it comes back positive, let me know and I will do my best to reschedule you later on free of additional charge, or if that is not possible I will refund your deposit. No hard feelings or anything if so.  
<br>
**I ask that you please honor this as I have increased risk of complications from COVID.**  
- Please **RESCHEDULE** if you were in contact with someone that got it. I will reschedule w/ no additional deposit or refund if necessary for this!!  
- Please **NO companions**, though they are welcome to accompany you up to the point of the building door.  
- Please **EAT before** your appointment! Also please bring your own water bottle.  

### Last note -  I have a chronic cough  
I've had it for about 7 years. It is due to non-infectious reasons (stomach issues). On worse days I will have spurts of coughing, on better days it's barely there - I just want to disclose this beforehand as it understandably can make people nervous. I will be masked up the whole time of the appointment.
